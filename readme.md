# Biggie Smalls Tribute
One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project.


Essentially, this part is your sales pitch.

UX
The website is for fans of the famous rapper to view to have a centralised place where they can connect with him. 
I tried separate different components of the artist from a landing page to his music and merchandise along with a wikipedia embed

My aim so to provide an urban feel to the site but with clean lines and minimal interuption.


## User Stories

As a user I can view the artist most famous songs and listen to them from within the webpage. I can also view his album artwork and his wikipedia from the about section.
